# motif-mark
Visualize motifs from input FASTA sequences.
This project takes in a file containing motif sequences to be searched for and a fasta file containing genetic locations for the motifs to be placed upon. Build an image to display the relative motif locations upon any RNA/DNA sequence. See the .pdf for an example image.

--file: full file path to fasta
--motif: full file path to file containing motif sequences
